# Estimating Smooth Covariance for Functional Data


This repository contains the implementation code for the study "Estimating Smooth Covariance for Functional Data". 

## Methods Implemented

- **Low Rank Covariance Estimation**: A computationally efficient method for estimating covariance functions with reduced dimensionality.
- **Positive Definite Covariance Estimation**: A method that ensures the estimated covariance surface is positive definite.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- [fdaM] MATLAB package (included in this repository)


## Demo

The repository includes a comprehensive demo file with extensive implementation examples.


The demo demonstrates:
- Data generation for functional observations
- Implementation of both proposed methods
- Visualization of results
- Comparison between methods
